# IR & Forensics Specialist — Role Notes

Responsibilities
- Lead incident handling, evidence collection, forensic analysis and remediation guidance.

Comprehensive tutorial — Incident Response & Digital Forensics

Purpose and scope
- This tutorial explains practical IR & forensic workflows used to detect, contain, and investigate security incidents, preserve admissible evidence, and feed lessons learned back into detection and prevention. It is role-focused: investigator, examiner and technical lead responsibilities.

Core competencies
- Triage and escalation: rapid validation of alerts, scope determination, high-level containment decisions.
- Evidence preservation: volatile data capture, imaging, chain-of-custody documentation.
- Forensic analysis: memory, filesystem, malware behavior, timeline reconstruction, network packet forensics.
- Reporting & remediation: executive and technical reporting, remediation guidance and follow-up validation.
- Tooling & automation: using open-source and commercial tools, scripting repeatable collection and triage steps.

Incident response lifecycle (practical steps)
1. Preparation
   - Maintain playbooks for common scenarios, pre-approved containment actions, forensic kits (USB, write blockers, tool VM).
   - Ensure logging, centralized collection (SIEM), EDR coverage and secure backups are in place.

2. Identification & Triage
   - Validate alert: correlate SIEM/EDR/ticket data. Identify impacted hosts, accounts, and services.
   - Assign severity, isolate affected assets (network segmentation, process kill, disable user), and start timeline.

3. Containment (short & long term)
   - Short-term: isolate network, block C2 domains/IPs, remove compromised credentials, snapshot VMs or take volatile captures.
   - Long-term: rebuild from known-good images, change passwords, patch vulnerabilities, update detection rules.

4. Evidence collection & preservation
   - Volatile data first: collect memory, running processes, network connections, open files, and logged-in users.
   - Document chain-of-custody: who collected, when, how, and where artifacts are stored (hashes for integrity).

5. Analysis
   - Memory forensics: use Volatility/rekall to extract processes, DLLs, injected code, sockets, credentials in memory, and suspicious artifacts.
   - Timeline reconstruction: combine timestamps (logs, file metadata, event logs) to create an accurate attack timeline.

6. Attribution & root cause
   - Map TTPs to frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK), identify initial access vector, lateral movement, privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms.
   - Validate whether incident is targeted or opportunistic.

7. Remediation & recovery
   - Remove persistence, patch exploited vulnerabilities, rotate credentials, harden configurations, restore from clean backups.
   - Validate with scans, improved detection logic, and proactive hunts.

8. Reporting & lessons learned
   - Produce two reports: short executive summary (impact, business risk, remediation status) and detailed technical report (IOC, timelines, forensic artifacts, recommendations).
   - Update playbooks, detection rules, and run tabletop exercises to close gaps.

Key forensic artifacts to collect
- Memory dumps (complete), pagefile and hibernation files.
- Full disk images or VSS snapshots, event logs (Windows Event, Sysmon), shell artifacts (LNK, Prefetch).
- Browser history, email headers, PowerShell logs, WMI event logs.
- Network captures (PCAPs), firewall and proxy logs, cloud service logs (CloudTrail, Azure AD sign-ins).
- EDR artifacts and Sensor logs.

Essential tools & quick tips
- Memory: Volatility, Rekall; start with pslist/pstree, malfind, dlllist, connscan, netscan.
- Disk/Filesystem: Autopsy/SleuthKit, FTK Imager, EnCase (commercial).
- Network: Wireshark, Zeek, tcpdump.
- Effective IR & forensics requires discipline, documentation, and reproducible workflows. Focus on repeatable collection, sound chain-of-custody, and integrating findings back into detection and prevention.
