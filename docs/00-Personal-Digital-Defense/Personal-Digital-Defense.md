### 📝 What is Digital Defense?

The project at digital-defense.io is **The Ultimate Personal Security Checklist**. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and features:

*   **Objective**: To provide practical, step-by-step guidance for people to secure their digital lives. The content is a "living document" that is updated regularly by a community of contributors to reflect the latest threats and best practices.
*   **Scope**: The checklist is extensive and categorized into different aspects of digital life:
    *   **Authentication**: Using password managers, 2FA, and breach alerts.
    *   **Web Browsing**: Privacy-respecting browsers, search engines, and tracker blocking.
    *   **Communication**: Secure email and messaging providers.
    *   **Devices**: Securing mobile phones, computers, and smart home devices.
    *   **Other Areas**: Also covers social media, networking, personal finance, and the "human aspect" of security.
*   **Structure for Learning**: The checklist is divided into three tiers, making it approachable for everyone:
    *   **Essential**: Foundational security practices.
    *   **Optional**: Additional steps for greater protection.
    *   **Advanced**: Measures for those seeking maximum security.
